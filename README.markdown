Open documentation of the highlighted selection in a webbrowser. WOW !

### Like a noob

Download plugin as a zip file.
Go to your Packages subdirectory under ST2's data directory and unzip here. 

## Usage

* Highlight something
* Either :
	* Press F1 for documentation, F2 for google it
	* Right click on selection
	* Command Palette

## Languages supported

* C++
* Java
* Python

That's all because this is what I need for the moment. But you can raise a new issue for requesting support for a language ( with an url of search engine, I don't work for you :) )
